# PicToAscii

PicToAscii (or ImgToAscii) accepts an image file, and a fixed set of characters. It assesses the characters for "brightness" (basically what percentage of the character is dark or light), and then outputs a text file with each pixel mapped to a character with the appropriate brightness.

This project is small, and was hacked together over an hour or two as a proof of concept.
